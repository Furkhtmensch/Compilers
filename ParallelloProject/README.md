Project made alongside Gon√ßalo Branquinho Mota.
Our aim is to create a fun and innovative language. The name is yet to be decided, and thus, for now, I shall call it Parallello.

Core properties for the language:
- Innovative boolean system;
- More "low level" ish control over the processor cores;
- Unique syntax;
